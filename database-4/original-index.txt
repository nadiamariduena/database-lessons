app.use(cors());  in this form means that i will use "Cross-origin resource sharing / CORS" for the whole page.
 but i hide it because i don't want all the pages to be shown, it serves more like Ioannis said, 
 to shown the area of a website which 
 is free and for the premium part which only few have access, in other words i decide what i shown and what not.

 Its useful for some apps for example when creating projects with API's

//---------------------
Why are CORS needed?
//---------------------


Why is CORS necessary? The CORS standard is needed because it allows servers to specify not 
just who can access its assets, but also how 
the assets can be accessed. Cross-origin requests are made using the standard HTTP request methods.



//---------------------
Is CORS a security Risk?
//---------------------


If implemented badly, CORS can lead to major security risk like leaking of API keys, other users data or even
much more. A very great example of security risk of CORS misconfiguration is this:


https://medium.com/@ehayushpathak/security-risks-of-cors-e3f4a25c04d7

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
It is a browser’s mechanism which allows sharing of resources from different origins. 
So, basically you allow access to the websites you trust to share resource with, and 
when a website with another origin requests for a resource, the application sends an 
HTTP request with origin header. If the origin is trusted it sends back the requested 
resource with Access-Control-Allow-Origin andAccess-Control-Allow-Credentials header in response.
Origin header: Origin header contains the URL from where the request has originated.


Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This header is send back in the response from one website to a 
request originated from another website, telling the website that it is allowed to access the resource.
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: If this header is set to true then only you can share 
cookies and other credentials with another website.


CORS Specification
> Multiple origins:
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://domain1.com http://domain2.com
However, no browser supports multiple origins.
> Wildcards (*):
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
Sadly, you can use only this wildcard, means you allow each and every website, you 
can’t use wildcards on any other way like https://*.website.com to allow all subdomains of your website.
For security measures it automatically disables the Allow-Credentials header when using a wildcard. 

You need to specify a domain if you want to allow credentials.


//---------------------
Why is Cors bad?
//---------------------

CORS isn't bad practice. ... CORS is not security. If servers have resources that need 
to be protected from certain users, it is not safe to rely solely on the Origin header to 
enforce this. Your server needs some other mechanism for security (such as OAuth2 and 
CSRF protection)
