WHAT is Middleware ?


Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), 
the response object (res), and the next function in the applicationâ€™s request-response 
cycle. 

The next function is a function in the Express router which, when invoked, executes
the middleware succeeding the current middleware.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:


Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware in the stack.

// 2.)__ assign express a variable to start using it

/* 
Because I don't know if the server is going to be 3000 once I upload it to a real SERVER, 
to prevent the APP from breaking I have to type the following:  
 
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

List of HTTP status codes

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes




// 
// 
// ------
// 200    OK/successful
// ------
Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.
// 
// ------
// 201 Created
// ------
The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.
// 
// ------
// 202 Accepted
// ------
The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs.
// ------
// 400 Bad Request
// ------
The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)
// ------
// 401 Unauthorized 
// ------
Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication.[32] 401 semantically means "unauthorised",[33] the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
Note: Some sites incorrectly issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific address is refused permission to access a website
